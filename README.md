# Mediapipe & M5Stick Workout Tracker
This project is a repetition counting program that uses the Mediapipe Pose module to track the number of repetitions of a squat. The program uses BLE to communicate with the M5Stick, which aids in the repetition counting, and computer vision (cv2 library) to track what is happening via the laptop webcam.
